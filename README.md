# Heart Disease Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on their medical data. By analyzing various medical parameters and patient characteristics, the model will learn patterns that are indicative of heart disease risk.

## Goals
- Analyze medical report dataset to identify patterns and correlations
- Develop and train a machine learning model for heart disease prediction
- Evaluate model performance and accuracy
- Create a reliable tool for preliminary heart disease risk assessment

## Dataset
The project will use a medical dataset containing various patient parameters such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type (cp)
- Fasting Blood Sugar (fbs)
- Blood pressure (trestbps)
- Serum Cholesterol (chol)
- Resting Electrocardiographic (restecg)
- Maximum Heart Rate Achieved (thalach)
- Exercise Induced Angina (exang)
- ST Depression Induced by Exercise Relative to Rest (oldpeak)
- Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment (slope)
- Number of Major Vessels (ca)
- (thal)
- Diagnosis of Heart Disease (num)

## Technical Stack
- Python
- Libraries:
  - Pandas (for data manipulation)
  - NumPy (for numerical operations)
  - Scikit-learn (for machine learning)
  - Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
